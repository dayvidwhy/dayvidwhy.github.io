    <h1 class="default-title">About</h1>
    <p>My name is David Young. I have been making websites for the past few years and enjoy writing about my discoveries. I obtained a degree in Information Technology from the <a href="http://uq.edu.au">University of Queensland</a> in 2016, and previously worked as a tutor, teaching first year website development there.</p>
    <p>I initially obtained a Civil Engineering degree from UQ, however I took a programming course in my final semester of study and have been hooked since. I started out my second degree with the expectation of building desktop programs, however I have taken a strong interest in the web and what it has to offer.</p>
    <p>I have since built a few projects and constantly find myself reading blogs or watching talks online as I strive to expand my knowledge on the seemingly endless topic of web development.</p>
    <h1 class="default-title">Languages</h1>
    <p>Some of the programming languages I speak are listed below.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML5</li>
        <li>CSS3</li>
        <li>JavaScript/ES6+</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>C</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also enjoy using frameworks such as <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which I used to build this website!</p>
